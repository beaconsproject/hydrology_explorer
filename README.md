# Hydrology Explorer

BEACONs Hydrology Explorer identifies areas upstream and downstream of an area of interest (AOI; e.g., conservation area, mine site, etc.) and associated hydrologic metrics, using the BEACONs catchment dataset as building blocks. 

When studying or managing landscapes, it is important to recognize that the condition and function of **an area of interest (AOI) such as a conservation area or management zone** can be influenced not only by activities within its boundaries, but also by factors beyond them. Areas are vulnerable to external pressures through edge effects as well as the movement of surface and groundwater. Because rivers and other aquatic systems are highly connected, an AOI may be affected by human activities both upstream and downstream, including water diversion, pollution, or the loss of natural inputs such as organic matter from riparian zones ([Pringle 2001](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761%282001%29011%5B0981%3AHCATMO%5D2.0.CO%3B2)). **An AOI such as a mine site or dam** may be a source of pollutants or changes to water flow, for example. To better understand and manage these influences, it is valuable to consider the hydrologic connectivity of the AOI and the extent to which it is connected to upstream and downstream areas. This perspective helps quantify human impact and supports more informed decisions for stewardship, monitoring, and long-term sustainability both within and outside of the AOI.
