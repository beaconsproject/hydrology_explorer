# Hydrology Explorer

BEACONs Hydrology Explorer identifies areas upstream and downstream of an area of interest (AOI; e.g., conservation area, mine site, etc.) and associated hydrologic metrics, using the BEACONs catchment dataset as building blocks. 

When studying or managing landscapes, it is important to recognize that the condition and function of **an area of interest (AOI) such as a conservation area or management zone** can be influenced not only by activities within its boundaries, but also by factors beyond them. Areas are vulnerable to external pressures through edge effects as well as the movement of surface and groundwater. Because rivers and other aquatic systems are highly connected, an AOI may be affected by human activities both upstream and downstream, including water diversion, pollution, or the loss of natural inputs such as organic matter from riparian zones ([Pringle 2001](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761%282001%29011%5B0981%3AHCATMO%5D2.0.CO%3B2)). **An AOI such as a mine site or dam** may be a source of pollutants or changes to water flow, for example. To better understand and manage these influences, it is valuable to consider the hydrologic connectivity of the AOI and the extent to which it is connected to upstream and downstream areas. This perspective helps quantify human impact and supports more informed decisions for stewardship, monitoring, and long-term sustainability both within and outside of the AOI.

**Online Access**

Hydrology Explorer is hosted on the shiny server and can be accessed online: 
https://beaconsproject.shinyapps.io/hydrology_explorer/

**Demo Dataset**

A demo dataset can be downloaded [here](./doc/demo.gpkg). This is the same dataset embedded in the App and includes additional spatial layers that can be added to the App, including fires, mining claims, undisturbed and disturbed areas, linear and areal disturbances, and protected areas. 

To test out the **Optional Display Elements** step in the App, shapefiles of salmon spawning areas and critical mineral potential are available here: **Question: does hydrology explorer accept point data?**

**Regional Apps**

There are regional versions for the Cree Nation Traditional Territory in Quebec and Kaska Dena Traditional Territory (KDTT) in the Yukon, BC, and NWT. These applications can be accessed using the links below:
