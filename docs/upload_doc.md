### Add display elements (OPTIONAL)

This section allows users to add a maximum of three layers to the map for visualization purposes only (e.g., salmon spawning sites, critical mineral potential). These layers can be uploaded as Shapefiles or as layers from a GeoPackage. Layers will appear on the map using their original names (maximum 25 characters).
