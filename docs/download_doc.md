### Download results

Results can be downloaded as a GeoPackage that includes the following spatial layers: **ADD csv download for the statistics tables**

- **studyarea**: polygon of the study area
- **aoi**: polygon of the area of interest
- **catchments**: catchments dataset for the study area **Question: if calculated by the App, is proportion intact added to the dataset?**
- **streams**: stream network associated with the catchment dataset
- **upstream**: area upstream of the AOI identified by the App
- **downstream stem**: downstream stem identified for the AOI by the App
- **downstream**: downstream area identified for the AOI by the App
      
If provided, the following layers will also be added to the GeoPackage: 
- **intactness**: spatial layer uploaded to calculate catchment intactness 
- **fire**: spatial layer of wildfires used to calculate fire statistics

The GeoPackage can be further viewed and analysed in a GIS e.g., QGIS.
