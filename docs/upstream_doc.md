### Generate upstream and downstream

Here, the user launches the App to idenitify the areas upstream and downstream of the AOI. To initiate, click on the **View upstream and downstream intactness** button on the left sidebar. When done, the following upstreamm and downstream areas will be added to the Mapview legend, and the statistics tables will update.  

- **upstream area**: area upstream of the AOI as defined by catchments 
- **downstream stem**: area downstream of the AOI as defined by the main stream exiting the AOI and associated catchments
- **downstream area**: area downstream of the AOI as defined by the downstream stem as well as all streams flowing into the stem
