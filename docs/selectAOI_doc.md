### Select AOI

The app offers two options for specifying the AOI (area of interest) for which upstream and downstream areas will be identified: 

1. **Upload an AOI**  - The AOI can be uploaded as a ShapeFile or a GeoPackage. The AOI will be clipped to the study area boundary. Users have the option to edit the AOI boundary by selecting catchments. 

2. **Select a set of catchments on the map** - This option allows users to idenity an AOI by selecting catchments on the map. The AOI may be comprised of non-neighbouring catchments such as geographically dispersed salmon spawning sites or mine sites. All selected catchments are combined to form a new area of interest (AOI) for analysis.

Note: The upstream and downstream area will not be computed beyond the extent of the provided catchments layer. 

The statistics table will update with additional statistics, including Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) for the AOI. DCI is a measure of longitudinal connectivity within the AOI, ranging from 0 (low connectivity) to 1 (high connectivity) (Cote et al. 2009).
